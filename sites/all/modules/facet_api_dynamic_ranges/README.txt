The Facet API Dynamic Ranges module provides widget for range queries.

Unlike other Facet API ranges modules this module doesn't need any aditional
settings. It takes minimum and maximum prices from the products and calculates
step for the range. And then based on these values builds dynamic array with
ranges.
